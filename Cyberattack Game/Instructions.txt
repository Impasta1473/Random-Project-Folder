————————— Setup —————————
	1.	If you don’t have python go to https://www.python.org/downloads/. if you paste the code into the CodeHS python sandbox skip to step 3.
	2.	In your terminal, use cd to get to the folder with Cybergame.py and run “python Cybergame.py” (use “python3” if “python” doesn’t work)
	3.	Enter the amount of AI players you want to compete with.
	4.	Enter what you want to be called in the game.
	5.	The game will run until you either get eliminated or achieve victory.
————————— Gameplay —————————
When your turn starts, you are shown your hand of cards. Enter a valid number to play that card. Once a card is played, you usually draw from the deck once. The last standing player who hasn’t been eliminated yet is the winner. Here’s what each card does:
	•	SKIP cards let you get away with endng a turn without drawing a card. If someone uses a TRANSFER card on you, it only skips one draw, not both. 
	•	TRANSFER cards immediately end your turn without drawing and forces the next player to draw twice after their turn.
	•	RANDOMIZE cards shuffle the remaining cards in the deck completely, making any INSPECT ELEMENT cards used previously become pointless.
	•	INSPECT ELEMENT cards allow you to peek at the top three cards on the deck. This can be very helpful for getting an advantage against other players by knowing what’s about to come next.
	•	BACKBURN DRAW cards are useful for you if you want to draw from the bottom of the deck. And that doesn’t mean draw from someone’s bottom either.
	•	NOPE cards can prevent almost any action, making that card seem wasted to the player. This may be counteracted by someone who has another NOPE card, which turns it into a YUP. Any cards marked with a * cannot be NOPE’d under any circumstances.
	•	HACK cards let one player control another temporarily, so the next two times the player gets a turn, it’s 100% up to the player to decide what to do, plus they have access to what cards they have in their hand.
	•	BACKDOOR TRANSFER cards force all opponents to each give two of their posessed cards to the player responsible for that card. The cards the players give up are chosen randomly, not by choice.
	•	DISABLE cards temporarily shuts down another player’s ability to take a turn twice, meaning they cannot do anything and their two turns are skipped.
	•	MOUSE, KEYBOARD, MONITOR and SPEAKER cards do not do anything on their own. If a player has two of a matching kind of these cards, they may use these cards to steal a random card from the next player.
	•	*CODE PATCH cards saves a player from elimination by canceling a CYBERATTACK card. Instead of losing, the affected player uses this card to sneak the CYBERATTACK card into any spot in the deck.
	•	*CYBERATTACK catds are the main “antagonist” of the game, eliminating any player without a CODE PATCH card immediately. Regardless of how many CODE PATCH cards you have, you show this card immediately when in possession of it.
	•	*POLYMORPHIC VIRUS cards are even more dangerous than CYBERATTACK cards, but can only be used if someone uses a CODE PATCH on a CYBERATTACK card. When that happens, the CODE PATCH card is canceled and can only be stopped by a second CODE PATCH card. 
————————— Notes ————————— 
	⁃	There are 85 cards in the deck. Once the deck runs low on cards, it will automatically take all played cards and reshuffle them into a new deck.
	⁃	You always go first to prevent unfair bugs from the AI players.
	⁃	No external packages are required for installation, as this is 100% vanilla python.
	⁃	This code is not 100% perfect, so expect some bugs and glitches with it. This may or may not be updated eventually in the future, depending on my schedule.
